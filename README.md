# theTipulator
## The tipping calculator

This is one of my first projects putting together what I've learnt using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.<br>
The idea behind The Tipulator is for people to be able to work out out how much of a tip they need to pay, depending on what the quality of service was like.
It will also break down the cost of what you need to pay per person.
